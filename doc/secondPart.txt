Hi everyone, welcome to today's session.
We'll talk about how we built a frontend project in XXX project, and show how we make all of those work together in our code.
All the session, We'll focus on the technology in frontend, not the devops or other skills.
We used many frameworks to make the code easy to write, test, build, deploy and maintain.
Let's introduce some of those to you.

-- technical map
It's a technical map for our code.
We use the NPM, React and Typescript as our base framework to support the OOP and Component function.
And for user experience, the MUI is our choose.
And for the restful api call, we chose Axios as the solution.
And for the developing without the backend, we chose MirageJs.
And for the testing, we chose Jest and Testing Library to test both the logic and UI.
And for the code check and format, we chose the eslint and husky.
That's all for the frameworks we'll share today. Next, let's share some sample introduction for all the frameworks to you.


-- React


-- MUI
MUI is a popular React UI framework. It provides a fast way to develop React applications. We can reuse many components already created by MUI team.

It's easy to import it to our React project. Just follow the documents at their website.

And for the components, we can use it in our code after import it the component.

We can customize MUI with our own theme. With the ThemeProvider can change the colors, the typography and much more.
